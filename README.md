# Total Recall

A dynamic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript solo project that uses the FDA's Food API to gather data regarding food recalls based on user input. The intention of the application is to keep users up to date on recalls that have occurred.

##Features
 * Display most recent recalls by default
 * Search by state
 * Search by dates
 * Search by both state and date
 * Display more information when a recall is selected
 
 ##What I learned
Through this project, I learned how to use APIs and gained a better understandsing of how AJAX works in background.

##Planned features
 * Users may save recalls for future reference
 * Expand the information given when a recall is selected
 * Users may select the amount of recalls to load
